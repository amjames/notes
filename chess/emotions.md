Emotions are maybe the hardest things to deal with during chess. The emotions
you feel during a game will determine whether you will play at your best
ability or not. Your emotions will also determine whether you'll have a fun and
constructive game. Equally important, your emotions will influence whether your
opponent has a fun and constructive game and whether they'll play at their best
ability or not.
