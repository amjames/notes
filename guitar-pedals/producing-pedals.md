# What I've learned from producing pedals

## Make accurate and precise measurements

Digital caliper might be a nice ideal, because it both saves time and gives
accurate and precise measurements. Not having to count the markings on
a straightedge is what saves time.

However, reliability is also key for anything in life. So it's definitely
possible that a good straightedge with a sliding marker is just fine and
gives almost the same result, without needing batteries.

## Use appropriately high tolerance to account for unknowns
